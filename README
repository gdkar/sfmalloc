SFMalloc: A Lock-Free and Mostly Synchronization-Free Dynamic Memory Allocator 
          for Manycores


* Supported architecture
x86 (64-bit)


* Tested environment:
Ubuntu 10.04 (64-bit)
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.5 (64-bit)


* Compilation:
SFMalloc is compiled with gcc. Since Makefile is provided, 
you need to do only 'make' in this source directory.


* Usage:
1) If you want to link SFMalloc statically,
  use libsfmalloc.a

2) If you want to use SFMalloc with dynamic linking,
  we recommend you use LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
  For example, when you execute your application,

  $ LD_PRELOAD=./libsfmalloc.so ./your_executable
